## Manual osint:

Here’s what I found about “Ishu Gupta” on the official BITS‑Pilani site:

| Detail        | Information                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Name          | Ishu Gupta                                    |
| ID Number     | 2019ABPS0896                                  |
| Program       | MS‑Research (SR)                              |
| CGPA          | Reported between 6.42 and 6.79 across semesters|
| Scholarship   | Merit Cum Need (MCN) – 15–25% tenure-based     |

This information appears in official merit/cum‑need lists published by the Student Welfare Department (SWD) for semesters 2020–21 and 2021–22 

found this info because he was is student welfare department and normally not foundable for normal students

## Social Media OSINT:

### linkedin:

linkedin basically provided me with all the info I needed to perform tools on Linux directly  
dob: January 30  
connected : oct 11,2023  
email address: ishugupta302005@gmail.com  
phone number: 8287305073

studies at: Bits pilani, Hyderabad campus  
joined in 2022  
graduate at 2026

post: zero  
organizations: bits pilani clubs  
followers: 871  
connection : 500+

### pinterest:

got some saved picture by him and some poster created by him  
and one pick he saved related to love  
might be for his lover or something 

I think I got enough info about him from his linkedin account  
and his Instagram,facebook handle is private so i cant perform osint on them 

so shifting to tools

---

## sherlock:

username: ishugupta302005 

i know his instagram username so i am performing scan using it only  
result:18 results with username ishugupta302005

i think the result sherlock will be providing wont be of much use as most of the result it give is not real ids o have to scan them manually 

ao found his twitter handle  
i always thought when it returns twitter handle and then the screen show user not found it was because u are not signed in so i will use my personal twitter account and search for him 

i also found his hackerrank account but maybe this too wont work 

bro i just found his details as once there was a hack in his college website 

i got a link and found that his ip address his emails password frquetly used website and stuff has been breached and uloaded to public database by someone on 21-07-2023 

i just talked to him and he said that there was a database hack in his college and details about student have been released or sold publically 

but i dont think this is that hack because according to him college database was targeted but here i am seeing that there is a malware used for finding info about him  
redline:malware

and someone injected this malware in his laptop but i know the location where the malware is inserted  
i know the malware path so i will scan his device for the malware producer and all when he gave me his laptop till then i will continue my osint and try to find more info leaked about him online

## Holehe 

holehe performed a scan on 123 website and positive result is found by 4 website only other might have stopped it or something  
- adobe  
- spotify  
- freelancer  
- replit

i dont know what to do with these so i will think about this later 

shfting to next tool

usually i would have performed other tools but as most of his data is already available online so i will directly use some powerful tool now 

---

## spiderfoot

### email address scan:
so based upon spiderfoot scan too data is breached of this username  
- boat-lifestyle.com  
- cit0dat.in 

are the hacker email addrss or might be places where this data breach is found

### username scan:

so i scanned using username but for that their is no result found so clean

### phone number scan:

so phone number scan didn't returned much returned the country name:india  
communication provider: reliance jio

so spiderfoot returned the same stuff mostly i knew data is breached his public details is released and public 

---

so now i will do two things  
- first perform phoneinfoga  
didn't worked returned no important info 

- second  
find a way to read data breaches info and read my brother stuff raw json if needed

i cant find the leaked data but working on it will find more tomorrow
