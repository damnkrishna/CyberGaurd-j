# OSINT PRAC 5

so I tried log analysis forensic part of cyber security but I didn't like it that much ya i got interest in osint related work because it really interest me and cools me off and the only thing I am able to do good atleast I feel I do that good

so before I start anything I am doing this because I want to know about a guy named [REDACTED] he is my college mate and actually a guy i always know have something in his mind and is skilled in something just i didn't know what

so when i started osint i got to know that there is a guy named [REDACTED] he use to create ctf room for 2025 batch of college so u can understand what level of expertise he must hold to build something like that so i cant just talk to someone now without knowing a thing about him maybe he is a very skilled cyber security guy and if i talk to him low he will consider me a newbie and i dont want that so i want to know complete info about him  
-which platform he use for practise  
-his skill set  
-his rank  
-his time of working (preffered)  
-his projects  
-his liking in cyber what he likes to work on  

everything so when i talk with him i can show him that i am interest too and i know what he knows or can rather show that i know this might give me a upper hand about knowing him and talking like a professional not just a beginner who think u do cyber i do cyber lets be friend type talk i want serious professional talk  
for that i need to know as much i can about him and study him actually well

so steps  
-linked

-oscd official website/Instagram  
-sherlock  
-holehe

## linkedin

Name: [REDACTED]

-graduate year: 2027  
-Foss enthusiast: Free and open source related work  
-connected: Aug 19,2024  

-email: [REDACTED]

-he reposted 2 days back about a OSDHAck'25 a 48 hour hackathon from July 11-13

well i dont actually know whether he host these ctf rooms or not because after reading the post i understood he just reposted and applied story not sure whether he might be the creater or just a reposter so ya lets proceed

-post 2: he created this project based upon the famous six degree of Wikipedia idea that two things are connected to one another by atmost six relationships or links based upon that he build a full stack project that works and do those stuff for him

-post 3: he reposted about a group project building a search engine that makes it easier for any git repo to be found based upon your readme.md or stuff u gave as input for the project

-post 4: his team created a full stack project that host a website which for each register make a personalized pokemon and assign that pokemon to u basically it works on the fork stuff of GitHub where he provides them a pokemon of them (no repition)or maybe repition is allowed

-post 5: this post finally stated something about cybersecurity which i was searching for but this too is reposted not something he posted  
but ya it talked about the passion of cyber professional and their interest for binaries and complex problems

-post 6: a website that uses publicly available data and identify which type of deforestation resulted in such type of land and have an accuracy of 76%

actually he did some really crazy good projects in his college life i am kind of amazed ya ik he must have some role in this but there is this guy named [REDACTED] whom i think is the one who did probably most of this stuff

but no judgment before checking myself.

-Core team Member of OSDC

-his skillset on linkedin include full stack mostly

and one meet related to cyber security at IIIT Delhi.

## GitHub

repositories: 15  
followers: 8  
following: 10

-project 1:  
not his own constructed project he forked it and maybe helped in some stuff i dont know what  
but it was a frontend chess community project

-project 2:  
second project again web development build some game using javascript

-project 3:  
okay another web deployement used google map api to create a Indian version of geogusser using javascript

-project 4:  
forked pokearcadia the project he posted about in linkedin providing pokemon to each person

-project 5:  
a simple high low game that provides u with a value and make u guess whether the artist have higher or lower number of follower than written in front(another full stack)

-project 6:  
a project for college using c++

this guy really did very little work on his git repo not professional at all

he got empty repo and no readme pages no about data about projects

-project 7:  
another project which he posted about OpenStreetMap provides u with location where u are using google map

-project 8:  
free and open source version of geoguesser with multiplayer mode  
he seriously got some interest in maps and locations

another not completed project in GitHub bro he seriously not serious about what he do and WhatsApp sematinc search system might be working but not complete yet

-project 9:  
another not completed project he is working on go for website development but here too he used something fancy to attract normal lads and somehow i got into this fish  
idea:  
An ai agent that extracts latest tech news from HackerNews according to your interests and questions.

-project 10:  
a website that reads torrent stuff and make it private for anyone to do secure search and stuff good project for learning networking and stuff but again not related to cyber security

i think i was wrong he is into cyber security instead i think he is just a web developer just like any other and here i was thinking i got a friend in this industry in my own college that do same stuff as that of me but na

so lets end this osint research by scanning him for username email and spiderfoot stuff

i am not anymore interested in him he is just a web developer with interest in api and ai and specially maps and locations

sherlock:  
got some account using this username not much use useless a discord account i already know of a twitter account no details there

holehe,thearvester:  
useless already knows those stuff nothing new

lol found something again i was not expecting fine lets proceed

-haveibeenpawned  
3 data breaches found might be weak password or something but my night just got long i have to scan for data about him

the source of leak  
-railyatri.in  
-truefire.com

so now i know his data have been breached and stuff so lets search for them in data leaked platforms

-intelx.io  
-shodan  
-dehashed

as i thought reading leaked data is a feature of paid version everywhere so i wont proceed further

but i completed my research and found that he is not the one who created ctf rooms and actually i dont think he got interest in cyber stuff  
but i do and i am the only one interested in it in my college and will do stuff that no one is able to do in cyber  
starting with mastering web exploitation
