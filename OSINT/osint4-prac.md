i think its time to use tools now

## Linux Tools

- sherlock  
  will be performing scan on his two usernames i know one from Instagram and other from his discord

  username: krishhsuri  
  result: 19 results

  chess.com: mar2,2025 joined  
  last active may 21,2025

  using this username didn't find much will now be stepping to next username

  username: krish._#4925kri

  based upon data this username has around 19 results  
  but none related to him except his discord where i found this username

- Holehe

  returned that 5 places this account have been used  
  a lot of them were stopped scan because of rate limit  
  - adobe.com  
  - amazon.com  
  - spotify.com  
  - twitter.com  
  - wordpress.com

- maigret  
  didn't returned much accuracy is fine but the thing i was searching for didn't find that

- spiderfoot

  started the scan might take 2-3 minutes  
  as i know this email have been breached ones or twice so expecting some good results here  
  though i never entered api keys required for running powerful tools

  - krish050805@gmail.com [truecaller.com]  
  - krish050805@gmail.com [gamingmonk.com]  
  - krish050805@gmail.com [dubsmash.com]

  spiderfoot too said the account has been breached or password too easy or something i have to find the leaked info somehow

what i was expecting the list is happening from last two days and it makes me feel happy as well as sad as i somehow able to find the data breaches in their account  
but i cant find the breached data and read it

i know it is unethical but later i will learn to read it somehow

- haveibeenpwned

  it returned that his email have been in 2 data breaches till now  
  email:krish050805@gmail.com

now i need to find what data have been leaked

so i performed scan on haveibeenpwned and i runned scan on others tools and each have different result this made me realize every application have different set of leaks they are scanning for so u cant just find data breach and trust it using one website

u have to try others too..
