# Malware Detection Guide

## Basic Detection Methods

So basically you mean if we have doubt that our computer is compromised or something is not right with our computer we can scan our device for bugs both ways:
- Physically checking hardware for bugs
- Check malware using tools like rkhunter, etc.

In the process there are different ways too for a device having Linux server and a device having dual boot server. I will be discussing Linux server only device first.

## Two Ways to Scan Linux Systems

So there are also two ways: first we can directly perform scan on our system but usually the bug installed by someone is kept in such a way that inside scan won't find it. It is kept hidden from even the scan performed by rkhunter and stuff.

So here comes the second way: we can switch off the system and while restarting we can insert our USB/pen drive having clean Linux server installed which you might have used while installing Linux server for the first time in your laptop/computer.

## Clean Boot Scanning Process

So insert it and after that you cleanly setup your environment before proceeding any further. When you are clean and setup then perform the scan using rkhunter and this way you are running all this from a separate setup which is clean hence the bug won't be kept hidden anymore and you can scan your whole device using tools directly.

So basically now we for sometime gain access of our desktop using USB we connected with in clean environment using chroot and then run our tool and scan the device.

```bash
mount --rbind /sys /mnt/sys
mount --rbind /dev /mnt/dev
chroot /mnt /bin/bash
rkhunter --check
```

## Dual Boot Considerations

All this talking I am doing is about Linux server only. Sometimes when you use dual boot the bug is stored either in Windows or in Linux and sometimes in the path between them that connects both. So if you're using Windows follow its steps - it's different from Linux.

## Real Threats

These bugs can be installed by anyone: your friend, your foe, sometimes when you leave your laptop for repairing and things they keep a backdoor open and install a bug and might even keep an eye on you. Yup everyone thinks that what will they even do with hacking your password and ID but it's very wrong - they basically have access to your whole screen so if you're doing any payment you're basically providing them with your card details and password that you will be entering without knowing anything.

I just learnt a little about malware and bugs and also a little about the tool used to find those bugs and all this because I was watching Mr. Robot season 3 episode 2 where he scanned his whole computer because of possible bug and there was really one.

## Warning Signs

Just because your laptop is "smooth" doesn't mean you're safe. The more skilled the attacker, the quieter they'll be.

So if you ever feel:
- Paranoid (with reason)
- See unknown login attempts
- Find unknown software
- Experience camera/mic triggering randomly
- See encrypted outbound traffic while idle
