# Cloud Computing

Well I am learning a very controversial thing compared to what my interest are in. I always wanted to secure website or server but cloud computing is the technique to give all your power storage tool everything to cloud and not handling that stuff on your own and even security is not anymore the concern of company if they have taken aws or azure cloud computing platform and paid for what they needed.

So there are 3 most common paying ways observed:
- **lead strategy** = adding capacity in advance 
- **lag strategy** = only adding resource when full capacity is reached 
- **match strategy** = adding small increment as demand increase

## Technology Innovations 

- **Clustering** => collecting all similar type or resources and tool together so whenever some problem arises or system failure happens it is easy to find the source as everything is divided based upon similarity and use 

- **Grid computing** => combining the power of multiple computer and dividing the work in small part and assigning them to multiple which will increase speed of completing task which might be impossible for one computer to complete like a single-super computer 

- **Virtualization** => using software to create multiple virtual computers inside a single physical computers its more like creating vm inside laptop to run another computer in your computer 

There has to be a cloud provider and a cloud consumer these two entity setup some ground rules and condition for hosting the server on cloud which is the reason there are roles and boundaries of a cloud written in service-level agreement (SLA).

## Scaling 

### Horizontal Scaling
- less expensive
- it resources instantly available
- resource replication and automated scaling 
- not limited by hardware capacity

### Vertical Scaling
- more expensive
- it resources normally instantly available
- additional setup is normally needed
- limited by maximum hardware capacity 

## Goals and Benefits of Cloud Computing
- reduced investments and proportional costs 
- increased scalability 
- increased availability and reliability 

## Risk and Challenges
- increased security vulnerability 
- data might be shared by cloud-based IT
- reduced operational governance control 
- limited portability between cloud providers 
- multi-regional compliance and legal issues
