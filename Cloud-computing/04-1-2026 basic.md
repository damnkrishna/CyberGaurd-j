# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing refers to delivering computing services over the internet, typically hosted in large data centers.

## Hosting Types
- **Cloud Hosting** - Resources shared across multiple servers in the cloud
- **Dedicated Hosting** - Exclusive server resources for a single client
- **On-Premise Hosting** - Infrastructure maintained on-site; best when security is the top priority

## AI as a Service (AIaaS)
Cloud-based AI capabilities provided as a service, eliminating the need for in-house infrastructure.

### Prerequisites
- Basic computer networking
- Operating systems
- Programming fundamentals
- Databases
- Virtualization

## Cloud Architecture

### Hierarchy
- **Region** - Geographic area containing multiple availability zones
- **Availability Zone** - Isolated locations within a region for redundancy
- **Data Center** - Physical facilities housing servers and infrastructure

## Cloud Engineering Workflow

### Core Tools
- **Docker** - Runs a single container (packages application with dependencies)
- **Kubernetes** - Manages multiple containers at scale
- **Minikube** - Local Kubernetes cluster for development and testing
- **kubectl** - Command-line tool to control Kubernetes
- **Pod** - Smallest deployable unit; wraps one or more containers
- **Service** - Exposes pods to network traffic, making them accessible

### Kubernetes Benefits
- **Auto-healing** - If a container dies, Kubernetes automatically creates a new one
- **Auto-scaling** - When users increase, adds more container copies; scales down when load drops
- **Cost optimization** - Reduces resources during low demand to save money

## types of services 
- Saas => software as a service
- Paas => Platform as a service
- Iaas => Infrastructure as a service
