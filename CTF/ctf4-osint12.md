# CTF OSINT Challenges Writeup

## CTF 1: Grain of Truth

So based upon the photo given for OSINT skills I found that this place is located somewhere in China as I found a pole with pic which have all the details about the location and pillar number and stuff but obviously can't be reached directly with it as it was written in Chinese so first I had to translate and based upon translation I found:

### Key Information Found:
- It was situated at south subdivision 26 pole number 15
- K2812: might be some ID
- CB64: utility code of pillar
- Situated somewhere near mainland China
- Urban/rural infrastructure
- Might be a pillar of some telecom provider like China Mobile/China Unicom
- Hao shou

### Methodology:
So this is how I proceeded - I used a pic (this pic pillar pic) on Google Lens which sent me to a Reddit messages which have the place location as then I found some nearby location of that place so I proceeded further by using street view of maps. I have to travel each and every where and at last found the place it was located at Taiwan.

## CTF 2: Lost Locomotive

So this one I tried harder for so now as I know first I saw that there is certain type of train that is running on the track it is quite unique design and have a unique number on it I found two locomotive train numbers 500,960 so based upon that I could have tracked their path down and solved this OSINT but I took different technique and the method I used was:

### Initial Approach:
I Google lensed the locomotive and found that it was somewhere near Machu Picchu at first so I scanned the street view for similar type of tracks and nearby water view with train station but it didn't helped so next I decided to scan the house that is very close and clearly visible in the picture that might be of use.

### Breakthrough:

So I scanned the house and surprisingly I found same picture of the house as it was somewhat related to Ollantaytambo in Inca town in Peru's Sacred Valley. Later I found one more post in which some traveller took that photo and mentioned Urubamba River as the nearby river which helped in narrowing down the location and soon with decent amount of street view scanning found the location and made my team earn some points finally.

## Conclusion

I was helpful to my team in some way.
