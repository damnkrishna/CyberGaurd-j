# Incident response and type of attacks

helps to identify an attack stop them and do that all so quickly that minimum amount of data gets leak and minimum amount of harm is done to the company that is the work of a incident response team well now adays there are so many type of attack that doing that work alone might be not safe for the company so they use several layer of protection for securing them and their company like setting up firewall and antivirus and set up intrusion detection system and following certain if any such breach is taking place or is observed inside a company

Eight domains for security are
- security and risk management
- asset security
- security architecture and enginerring
- communication network security
- identity and access management 
- security assessment and testing
- security operations
- software development security

Threat actor types
- advanced persistent threats 
- insider threats
- hacktivists

SIEM tool
- security information and event management tool
- automates or summarise log data to monitor critical activites in an organization

type of siem tool
- self hosted 
- cloud hosted
- hybrid 

type of security zones:
- uncontrolled zone
- controlled zone
- demilitarized zone
- restricted zone

Subnetting : dividing large network into smaller also enhances network efficiency and security 

CIDR:classless inter-domain routing 
- method for assigning subnet masks to Ip address
- more flexible and efficient ip address allocation

Proxy server
- forward => regulated and restricts a person access to internet
- Reverse => regulates the internets access to an internal server

Network Protocol
- communication protocol : establish connection between servers
- management protocol : troubleshoot network issues 
- security protocol : provide encryption for data in transit 


VPN : 
- uses encapsulation a technique to encrypt the data before sending it to public network 
- ex: wiregaurd vpn, IPsec vpn

DMZ => network zone that acts as a perimeter to an internal network isolating exposed servers


## DOS Attack(Denial of services)

- SYN Flood Attack(synchronize): simulates a tcp connection and floods a server with SYN packets

- Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) : tell other devices about data transmission errors across network 

- Ping of Death : when a hacker pings a system by sending it an oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 64KB


## Ip spoofing 
- tailgate attack
- on-path attack
- smurf attack
