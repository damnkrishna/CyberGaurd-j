# Incident Response and Types of Attacks

Incident response helps to identify an attack, stop it, and do that all so quickly that minimum amount of data gets leaked and minimum amount of harm is done to the company. That is the work of an incident response team. Nowadays there are so many types of attacks that doing that work alone might not be safe for the company, so they use several layers of protection for securing themselves and their company like setting up firewalls and antivirus, setting up intrusion detection systems, and following certain protocols if any such breach is taking place or is observed inside a company.

**Computer Security Incident Response Teams = CSIRT**

## Eight Domains for Security
- Security and risk management
- Asset security
- Security architecture and engineering
- Communication network security
- Identity and access management
- Security assessment and testing
- Security operations
- Software development security

## Threat Actor Types
- Advanced persistent threats
- Insider threats
- Hacktivists

## SIEM Tool
**Security Information and Event Management Tool**
- Automates or summarizes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization

### Types of SIEM Tool
- Self-hosted
- Cloud-hosted
- Hybrid

## Types of Security Zones
- Uncontrolled zone
- Controlled zone
- Demilitarized zone
- Restricted zone

## Subnetting
Dividing large network into smaller ones also enhances network efficiency and security.

**CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Routing**
- Method for assigning subnet masks to IP addresses
- More flexible and efficient IP address allocation

## Proxy Server
- **Forward** => Regulates and restricts a person's access to internet
- **Reverse** => Regulates the internet's access to an internal server

## Network Protocol
- **Communication protocol**: Establishes connection between servers
- **Management protocol**: Troubleshoots network issues
- **Security protocol**: Provides encryption for data in transit

## VPN
- Uses encapsulation, a technique to encrypt the data before sending it to public network
- Ex: WireGuard VPN, IPsec VPN

**DMZ** => Network zone that acts as a perimeter to an internal network, isolating exposed servers

## DOS Attack (Denial of Service)
- **SYN Flood Attack (Synchronize)**: Simulates a TCP connection and floods a server with SYN packets
- **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**: Tells other devices about data transmission errors across network
- **Ping of Death**: When a hacker pings a system by sending it an oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 64KB

## IP Spoofing
- Tailgate attack
- On-path attack
- Smurf attack
