# Who Am I (2014) - A Personal Analysis

I just finished watching Who Am I 2014 movie. I am thinking about the person and the movie since 3pm when I finished it and as I keep thinking I keep on realizing stuff about the movie. Somehow I understood how in the movie he manipulated the officer to make her realize that he's mentally sick and how he convinced her that he has multiple personality disorder when he has nothing and was just working social engineering skills to change her thinking and get out safely from the situation. Well it worked in the movie.

But how in the movie when he was manipulating the officer that all of them were his multiple personality, well even that made me think that it was true and the guy did have personality disorder cause those 4 personalities are all real and is something every person fights every day in his life day and night to decide which personality to maintain today. Just in the story he mentioned 4 personalities - one charismatic, confident, energetic and someone who knows the art of social engineering, then next the one who was fat and had long hair. That person fears stuff, keeps everyone reminded of the risk they were taking. That personality keeps the person connected to the ground making him or her remember the consequence of the things they are going to do in future.

Then 3rd, the one with extreme energy, no fear and a soul that is seeking fun and thrill. That is one of the most common things that a person usually fights sometime to achieve and to make his life fun or live a fun life. Sometime this personality is at peak.

And then 4th, our personality which fears being invisible, being someone no one cares about, someone who fears even thinking something out of the box. All these personalities somehow make a person's inner personality that is somehow explained in this movie very well that it is still amazing me.

## The Sugar Cube Scene

Specially the scene where the officer understood that she fucked up when she asked for how he did that magic trick. Well that scene alone took me 3 hours to understand what and why that change in expression happened during that scene of the officer. I knew something was not right but I can't understand what and now I understand.

In the magic the guy took 4 sugar cubes and after a sec it converted into 1 and when he explained the magic to officer he showed that the other 3 sugar cubes were gone nowhere. He just made the watcher or officer think that it was gone but it was in front of her and she never saw it. He just not showed it for sometime. That is the kind of movie it was. Somehow I am thinking a little too much about the movie.

And later when the officer's expression changed that was cause she realized that all he said was a lie and he never had personality disorder. He just hid the other 3 team members and made officer think that he was some mad person dealing with disorder and seeking care and medical attention.

## The Brilliance of Misdirection

What makes this film extraordinary is how it manipulates not just the officer, but us - the audience. We fall for the same social engineering tricks as Hanne does. The sugar cube magic trick is the perfect metaphor for the entire plot: misdirection. The other three "personalities" (his crew members) weren't gone, they were just hidden from view the whole time, right in front of her.

Even though Benjamin was lying about having dissociative identity disorder, the four characters he describes do represent real psychological archetypes we all navigate. The charismatic leader (Max/MRX), the cautious risk-aware one (Paul), the thrill-seeker (Stephan), and the invisible insecure one (Benjamin himself) - these are facets of human nature everyone experiences.

## The Ambiguous Ending

The film deliberately leaves the ending open to interpretation. Director Baran bo Odar has said he intentionally left unresolved whether Benjamin's friends are real or imaginary. Two interpretations exist:

1. **They were real** - Benjamin and his crew pulled off the ultimate social engineering hack, manipulated Hanne completely, then disappeared with new identities while she realized she'd been played but got what she wanted (MRX and FR13NDS exposed).

2. **Benjamin really has DID** - his mother had multiple personality disorder and committed suicide, it was genetically inherited, and he did everything alone.

The film plants clues supporting both interpretations, keeping you guessing even after the credits roll.

## Final Thoughts

The movie was a masterpiece for sure. It is going to my good film list. "Who Am I" is a fictional thriller inspired by real hacker culture and movements like Anonymous, but the events and characters are entirely made up. Yet it captures the essence of identity, the need to be seen, hacking culture, and how we construct narratives about ourselves so authentically that it feels real.

The fact that I spent hours puzzling out single scenes shows how well-crafted this film is. It's the kind of movie that stays with you, where layers keep revealing themselves long after you've finished watching.
