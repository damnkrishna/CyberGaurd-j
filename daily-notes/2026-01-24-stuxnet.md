# Stuxnet (Iran Nuclear Program)

## Introduction

well my todays goal is to read about a big hack that happened in the past and reverse-explain the procedure and working of it.

## The Discovery

so basically during 2009 iran was working silently on building nuclear bomb and doing research and development of a nuclear bomb at a air-gap place in iran.

well the discovery about iran working on something suspicious was expected by countries like usa and Israel and as I read about it was cause every military center and normal center for development have specific size but this iran nuclear program was at a area that was bigger than normal development program hence the suspicious arrised and resulted in Israel and usa join covert operation named mission oympics well by name u might think it was something related to olymipc but it was releasted to build technical war or u can also call cyberwar related stuff.

## The Strategy

well so these two countries worked for like months on developing a way that will both not result in global war and not raise sudden suspicion on them but still somehow result in either stopping or delaying nuclear program and in which they succeded.

so the work happened like this they thought targeting nuclear program with 100 or thousands of people might create a situation of war hence they decided not to target people rather target machinery that is controlled digitally by people through their computer hence the cyberwar.

as no presence of army no presence of killing just few lines of code and precise work within time and proper skills results in such a great hack that somehow opened a chain of action in all countries worldwide it was first cyber war even happened during the time.

## How It Worked

well as it is was a code and no one suspected it to happen that way people were not aware that it might be a worm or viruses that is resulting in such misfunctioning of huge amount of centrifuge devices in iran.

well the script was such that it doesn't steal data it doesn't kill device rather it allow the user or malicious intent people to get remote access to their machinery and update it as they wish well this would have been caught pretty easily.

### The Technical Details

if they left traces but this Stuxnet searched each infected PC for signs of Siemens Step 7 software, which industrial computers serving as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) use to automate and monitor electro-magnetic equipment.

and as soon as they get a device with this pcl program they just use some code some loophole in its code to get access to it and they even get access to the system manager of these device using zero days.

so even if they change the acceleration or rotation of a centrifuge through access of these computer it will not be shown in managers as they have hacked it too.

so no one knows about the problem and the worm will keep spreading and harming centrifuge silently shutting down or even bursting of centrifuge and no one knows the reason behind this as the effect is not shown directly but the nuclear program wont work.

the level of sophistication in this Stuxnet was far too complex for people to understand at that time.

## The Impact

and this not only delayed the nuclear program by 6 months to 1 year.

but it also targeted the mindset of developer and scientist and engineer that what went wrong they did everything perfectly this feeling of not able to find the problem for so long kill the inner confidence and skills trust of a person and i belive thats what they were targeting to build confusion chaos and self doubt in people at that time.

cause if a country decide to build nuclear power there is nothing one can do to stop them it can be delayed but it can never stop but u can kill their thinking and belief.

## The Discovery of the Attack

well if just the huge amount of centrifuge broken problem was not released by someone i believe that scientist and engineer would never be able to find such sophisticated attack.

it was found that all over iran at several places a large amunt of centrifuge were broken recently that resulted in engineer focusing their mind on centrigue that they started solving that problem even the code was hidden in rootkit but an expert can detect the problem and that what exactly happen.

## Attribution

also no one took responsibility of the attack till now but it was believed to be a joint operation between usa and Israel.

also they never said that iran was their target but it was quite clear from the number of devices affected as 60% of the devices were from iran hence it was believed to be a attack on irna.

## The Delivery Method

well there is one more thing as iran nuclear program also was so sophistacted that it was discconeted from all network and was air-gap and hence it cant be hacked from long distance so experts believe that this virus or worm was manually inserted by a spy or a hacker using a usb drive into one of the computer inside the nuclear plant.

well this clearly show someone has to be involved in planting it even they was not able to find the one responsible.

## The Perfect Cyber War

i believe it was a perfect cyberwar no traces of any connection left everything was just perfect no people harmed such a precision and such unique quality of using 4 zero days in one code was never seen before.

though later it was found that somehow there were also assassination of scientis inloved in nuclear plant and people believe it was also work of usa.

but except that it was perfect first ever cyber war that led every country to doubt their privacy and now the whole world know that they can be hacked and harmed without any phhyiscal bomb or killing but just a line of code that resulted in two big things.

## The Global Aftermath

**First Impact:**
every country started spending money and energy on securing machinery saving privacy and stopping cyber war attempt cause if it can be done ones it can be done again.

**Second Impact:**
second people started losing trust and protecting themselves at all cost.

## Conclusion

well this Stuxnet worm or virus is considered to be opened a pandora's box that weapon now cannot be drawn back its public now.
