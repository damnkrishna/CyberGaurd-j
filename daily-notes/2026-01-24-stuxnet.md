# Stuxnet: The First Cyber War

## Introduction

well my todays goal is to read about a big hack that happened in the past and reverse-explain the procedure and working of it.

## The Discovery

so basically since early 2000s iran was working on building nuclear capabilities and doing research and development at their uranium enrichment facilities, primarily at Natanz. The facility was air-gapped, meaning completely isolated from the internet and external networks for security.

well the discovery about iran working on something suspicious was expected by countries like usa and Israel. The intelligence agencies suspected Iran's nuclear program was aimed at developing weapons rather than peaceful energy purposes, which raised international concerns and resulted in Israel and usa joining for a covert operation named Operation Olympic Games. well by name u might think it was something related to olympic but it was actually the codename for what would become the world's first known cyberwar operation.

## The Strategy

well so these two countries worked for years (development began around 2005-2006 under President Bush) on developing a way that will both not result in global war and not raise sudden suspicion on them but still somehow result in either stopping or delaying nuclear program and in which they partially succeded. The operation was accelerated under President Obama who continued the program.

so the work happened like this they thought a military strike on nuclear facilities with bombers or ground forces might create a regional war and international crisis hence they decided not to target people rather target the machinery - specifically the centrifuges that were spinning uranium at extremely high speeds to enrich it. hence the cyberwar approach.

as no presence of army no presence of killing just sophisticated code and precise work over years with proper skills and resources (estimated at around $300 million and involving teams from NSA and Israel's Unit 8200) resulted in such a great hack that somehow opened a chain of action in all countries worldwide. it was first known cyberwar that caused physical destruction of infrastructure.

## How It Worked

well the first variant of stuxnet appeared in June 2009, though earlier versions existed since 2007. people were not aware that it might be a worm or virus that is resulting in such misfunctioning of huge amount of centrifuge devices in iran because it was so sophisticated and stealthy.

well the script was such that it doesn't steal data in the traditional sense, it doesn't just kill device, rather it allows the attackers to get remote access to the industrial control systems and manipulate them as they wish. this would have been caught pretty easily if they left traces but this Stuxnet was incredibly sophisticated.

### The Technical Details

Stuxnet searched each infected PC for signs of Siemens Step 7 software, which industrial computers serving as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) use to automate and monitor electro-mechanical equipment like centrifuges.

and as soon as it found a device with this PLC program it exploited vulnerabilities in the code to get access to it. The worm used four zero-day exploits (previously unknown security vulnerabilities) - an unprecedented number for a single piece of malware. These included vulnerabilities in Windows shortcuts, print spooler, and privilege escalation flaws, plus exploits in the Siemens PLCs themselves.

so even when they changed the acceleration or rotation of a centrifuge through access of these computers it would not be shown to the operators because they had also compromised the monitoring systems. The malware would record normal operations for about 2 weeks, then play back this normal footage to operators while it was actually attacking the centrifuges.

so no one knows about the problem and the worm will keep spreading and harming centrifuges silently - either making them spin too fast (up to 1,410 Hz for 15 minutes) or too slow (down to 2 Hz for 50 minutes), causing them to tear themselves apart or become damaged, and no one knows the reason behind this as the effect is not shown directly to operators but the nuclear program wont work as efficiently.

the level of sophistication in this Stuxnet was far too complex for people to understand at that time. It was written in multiple programming languages (C, C++, and others) and required deep knowledge of industrial systems, which indicated nation-state level resources.

## The Impact

and this not only delayed the nuclear program by an estimated 1 to 2 years according to experts.

but it also targeted the mindset of developers and scientists and engineers - imagine doing everything perfectly according to your knowledge but still seeing centrifuges failing at an alarming rate. this feeling of not being able to find the problem for so long kills the inner confidence and skills trust of a person and i believe thats what they were also targeting - to build confusion, chaos and self doubt in people at that time.

cause if a country decides to build nuclear power there is nothing one can do to permanently stop them, it can be delayed but it can never be completely stopped, but u can kill their thinking and belief and make them doubt their own capabilities.

## The Discovery of the Attack

well in early 2010, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visiting Natanz noticed an unusually large number of centrifuges were being replaced. Normally Iran replaced a few hundred per year due to normal wear and tear, but surveillance footage showed somewhere between 900-1,000 centrifuges (roughly one-fifth or 10% of their total) being decommissioned in just a few months. This was highly unusual.

Iranian technicians were completely puzzled and even fired some engineers thinking it was their incompetence. In mid-2010, they contracted a computer security firm from Belarus to examine their computer systems. These security specialists eventually discovered malicious files on the Iranian computer systems - this was Stuxnet.

The worm became publicly known in June 2010 when it was first identified by security researchers. By July 2010, it had spread beyond Iran and was found on computers worldwide, though 60% of infected systems were in Iran, making the target obvious. even though the code was hidden using sophisticated rootkit techniques, expert security researchers were able to detect and analyze the problem.

## Attribution

neither the USA nor Israel has officially taken responsibility or admitted involvement in the attack till now, but it is widely believed and reported by multiple credible sources including The New York Times to be a joint operation between the two countries through their intelligence agencies (NSA and Israel's Unit 8200).

it was also quite clear from the evidence: 60% of infected devices were in iran, the malware specifically targeted Iranian centrifuge models, and the sophistication required nation-state level resources. In 2011, a video celebrating the retirement of Israeli Defense Forces head Gabi Ashkenazi even listed Stuxnet among achievements, though this was quickly noticed and discussed. President Ahmadinejad himself admitted in November 2010 that a computer virus had caused problems for their centrifuges.

## The Delivery Method

well there is one more thing as iran nuclear program also was so sophistacted that it was discconeted from all network and was air-gap and hence it cant be hacked from long distance so experts believe that this virus or worm was manually inserted by a spy or a hacker using a usb drive into one of the computer inside the nuclear plant.

well this clearly show someone has to be involved in planting it even they was not able to find the one responsible.

## The Perfect Cyber War

i believe it was a perfect cyberwar no traces of any connection left everything was just perfect no people harmed such a precision and such unique quality of using 4 zero days in one code was never seen before.

though later it was found that somehow there were also assassination of scientis inloved in nuclear plant and people believe it was also work of usa.

but except that it was perfect first ever cyber war that led every country to doubt their privacy and now the whole world know that they can be hacked and harmed without any phhyiscal bomb or killing but just a line of code that resulted in two big things.

## The Global Aftermath

**First Impact:**
every country started spending money and energy on securing machinery saving privacy and stopping cyber war attempt cause if it can be done ones it can be done again.

**Second Impact:**
second people started losing trust and protecting themselves at all cost.

## Conclusion

well this Stuxnet worm or virus is considered to be opened a pandora's box that weapon now cannot be drawn back its public now.
