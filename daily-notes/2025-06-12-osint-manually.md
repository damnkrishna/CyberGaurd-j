# How I Discovered OSINT and Why It's Actually Kinda Crazy

So I was just scrolling through Reddit for timepass and saw this random question where someone asked whether people can find info about them just from their public profile.

Then suddenly this random guy starts replying and literally tells the person's full background just by checking his profile, posts, and accounts. Everyone in the comments was like "bro how!?"

At first, even I was like—"WTF?? Is he hacking him or what?"
But then he replied saying this isn't hacking or anything shady.
It's called **OSINT**.

At that point I was like, what even is this OSINT? I thought it's something super technical. But later, after searching a bit, I realized it's nothing like hacking. It's just about using public information and some tools to find out things about someone. Basically, it's smart searching.

And yeah—it doesn't work on private handles or people who've kept themselves hidden. But that doesn't mean they leave zero traces.

Let's say someone never posts publicly, never makes accounts visible—but what if their friend posts a photo with them on their public profile?
**Boom**—you didn't do anything, but now someone has info on you. That's what I mean by everyone leaves traces. It's not always your fault, but it's out there.

This made me think:
*If it's public, if it's legal, if it doesn't involve hacking, why shouldn't everyone learn it?*

Even people who aren't into hacking or cyber should know this stuff.
Think about it—sometimes in real life you have to meet or deal with someone you don't know much about, and you want to be a bit prepared.
And yeah, technically doing this without consent sounds creepy or illegal—but if done for positive reasons or awareness, I think it's fine.

So I decided to shift a little from my main goal and start studying OSINT first, before getting deep into web application hacking.

## What I Learned First

I started with simple Google search tricks—like using:

```
site:example.com keyword
filetype:pdf keyword
```

And man, it really shows stuff that doesn't come up normally when you search.
It feels like unlocking a hidden level of Google.

I honestly believe people interested in data analytics, research, or even journalism should know this.
Some of my friends are into analytics and they might say, "We don't need this," but trust me, it's useful.

## EXIF Data — Metadata Inside a Photo

Next I learned about Exif data from photos.
You might've heard about how journalists use it. If not, let me tell you one cool story.

So I was listening to this hacking podcast, and they talked about a soldier who posted a photo from a secret army base somewhere near Iraq.
He uploaded the pic after some time, but he forgot the metadata inside the image.

A journalist saw it, pulled the EXIF data, and found the GPS location and time.
That's how he figured out the soldier was near a hidden base. The guy got curious, looked more into the soldier, and using OSINT tools, found his address, wife's name, kids' names—everything.

Eventually, that journalist convinced the soldier to talk, and the world found out about a war that was supposed to be kept hidden.

**All this from just one picture.**

## OSINT Can Be Physical Too

In movies, you see people go in disguise to check out a place before they do something big—like checking for security cameras, guards, blind spots.

But now you can do that from home.

- Use satellite view
- Use street view
- Zoom into gates, backdoors, corners where there's no camera
- You can even fly a drone from 1-2 km away and get a full view of the place, no risk.

This is also a form of OSINT—**physical OSINT**.

## Data Breaches – Your Info Might Already Be Out There

You might've heard that after a site gets hacked, people are told to change passwords.

That's because sometimes emails, passwords, and user info get leaked online.

There are tools in Kali and even some websites where you can check if an email or account was part of a data breach.
Most of these sites are paid now, but it's still a good skill to know.

**Your data might already be out there and you wouldn't even know.**

## Hunting Usernames

Another cool trick is username hunting.
A lot of people use the same username everywhere.
So if you know one account, you can search for the same username across platforms and connect the dots.

You might find:

- Old accounts
- Linked social media
- Hobbies, habits, photos, old posts

This is honestly where it starts feeling like being a real detective online.

## Final Thoughts

So yeah, OSINT isn't hacking.
It's smart searching using public info.

It's **powerful**.
It's **useful**.
And I feel like everyone should learn it.

From journalists to data guys to curious people—it's a skill that opens up a new way of looking at the internet and info.

Right now, I've paused my web app hacking study to dive into OSINT.
It feels more real, more practical, and more powerful for now.

Let me know what you think.
**Should OSINT be taught to everyone?**
