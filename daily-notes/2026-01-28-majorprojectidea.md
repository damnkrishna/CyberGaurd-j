well so i was thinking to create a malware detection system using ai/ml but i will be specifically gonna use federated system so that no one have to share any file or malware binaries we will just check and secure our lost computer on our and send file report to the central data rather than sending whole data to centralized system and then performing detection this helps in keeping data secure and also help in creating better rule book for future detection and practises
