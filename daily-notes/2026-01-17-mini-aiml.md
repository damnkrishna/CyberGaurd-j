# My Machine Learning Journey: From Copy-Paste to Critical Thinking

## The Realization

well the importance of following proper procedure while generating model is quite clear now earlier I thought we can do any change it wont effect cause I was copy pasting script directly and not thinking why something was happening but here too everythink is connected u have to perform trial and error and using heatmap we can find which two have more stuff in common and it is actually a lot about crtitical thinking rather than just copy pasting stuff which is the best part I always thought ai is boring but it too learning is like a game u have to study it and try to increase its reg score with trying different features and different model and different train split and stuff its like u can try multiple things to create the one which provide maximum output and actually which is great 

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

so this is when the data set is supervised and someone is guding me what to do and how to do it in case of unsupervised fresh data it is quite interesting and challenging thinking from start to end and building combination which satisfy the result and its a lot like interesting stuff with many interesting stuff I never thought I would say this but it is quite interesting to do thing that's why everyone everysecond person is doing it cause it is interesting it is like a game plus it gets u job that's like having fun and getting paid doing that well its quite a good thing 

## Starting My Own Project

well I finished a video walkthrough now time to try to build a small project on my own... fine so lets begin this one project 

### My Planned Workflow

so we start by:
- first importing necessary module 
- then uploading the dataset 
- then observing dataset identify important feature and student future based upon normal student pattern 
- after that normalise data into numerical or float value so to ease the training model 
- then based upon dataset and after cleaning the data form heatmap and plt figure to analyze the type of data 
- and then identify what type of stuff to predict upon the student final total grade or student each subject grade like student who scored above 75% in total or student who scored 75% above in each subject 
- and using such data form x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test data 
- and finally use different model and predict its accuracy 
- and if everything is working correct use the model and test the dataset u kept for testing and try to increase its accuracy based upon different model which suits best 

## The Challenge

well so I know what I have to do with dataset what technique to perform but I am not sure what code to write for it so I was wondering what exactly do I have to do 

### Data Preprocessing Plan

so first I will tell u the changes I will do to the dataset:

#### Gender Encoding
as there is two gender male and female and I cant keep it as string type so I have to convert it into binary 0=male and 1=female 

#### Race/Ethnicity Encoding
then as there is 2-3 type of race or ethnicity so instead of putting it in numeric value I wil create three column one for race a one for b and one for c then on each student I will set the value of race a as 1 if he is from race a and other two 0 it will help in keeping value clean and find relation between stuff 

#### Lunch Type Encoding
next I will change the value of lunch type so as far as I know there are two type of lunch standard and free/reduced so I will convert it into binary 0 1 

#### Test Preparation Course Encoding
similarly I will do for test preparation course either student have done it or have not done it so that too I will convert it into 0 and 1 

#### Parent Education Level Encoding
then parents level of education that is something that is varying for everyone so cant put it in 0-1 instead I will do the thing I did for race and create new columns for each level of education that is possible 

### The Confusion

well there is one thing I am confused about data shows highet level of education so if someone have done masters degree then he must have completed high scholl and some college or stuff so do I have to put it like him in every single one well it will give crazy accuracy and I guess I should do this it will require some coding but fine I can do that or make ai do that for me 

### Deciding the Target

next and the most important I have to decide upon what I am going to predict this dataset I need a goal or target so for now I am keeping that target as avg marks scored should be greater than 50 or for easiness I can keep something like avg marks scored by student based upon given data 

### Another Question

well I am little confused too about some stuff so there are column regarding marks scored in maths writing and English so when I construct a new column about avg score do I remove the individual score of student 

## The Execution

well lets see we will go one by one from start to end regarding what I stated above 

## The Results

well I did all the above step and accuracy came out just fine 68% well i dont expect it to give 80% on second project of my own with such small dataset of only 1000 rows
