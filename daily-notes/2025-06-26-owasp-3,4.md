## OWASP 3: Command injection 

it is a unique but most observed way of cracking into web application without having to gain admin access by directly talking to the database and sending data base some sql command that can directly give us access to deleteling,viewing ,midifying data base based upon our need 

we can give inline command to the server and based upon that can make it return things we wish to find for example if some command need input from user to show output then we can send inline message that will take the place of user input and give us direct output based upon inline command 


Key Signs a Website Might Be Vulnerable:
-Forms or parameters that take hostnames, IPs, filenames, etc.
-Functions like system(), exec(), shell_exec() are used in backend code.
-Input isn’t sanitized or validated properly.


okay so i cant just try to do command injection on any web application that why i am using tryhackme room for owasp top 10 paths 


so now i have to navigate to http://MACHINE_IP:82/ 
-nothing found in view source no further paths connected no asssets or login page found 
- only one dropdown and one input box i think its simple one we just need to send input to user 
like `127.0.0.1;whoami`
and stuff

so first i have to find strange file name in the root director
so i used just ls command to show all files in root 
and found: drpepper.txt 

now i need to find the data inside the file 
for that i will be trying first using cat command to see whats inside the file 
hope so it will work 

na it didn't worked for finding user info i have to use different ways to get user data like for finding name of users working i had to use ps -ef command that tell the different process running in the background and their location of storage too 

which later helped me in finding path to root user 

also i have to find Linux version for that too i have to go /etc/alpine-release 

document and there the version was kept 

its a process which needs to be practised as much as possible because no one know where the details is hidden ya in ctf and rooms

we know that it is hidden somewhere but in real life we cant proceed like this we have no guaranty of finding anything still we keep on going further and further

in hope to either learn something or find something 

## OWASP 4: Insecure Design

Insecure design vulnerabilities arise from flaws in the architecture or concept of an application, not from poor implementation or configuration. They often result from inadequate threat modeling during the planning stages, or from insecure shortcuts taken by developers (e.g., disabling OTP validation during testing and forgetting to re-enable it in production).

Example: Instagram Password Reset Flaw
Instagram used a 6-digit SMS code for password resets and implemented rate limiting to block brute-force attempts after 250 wrong tries per IP address. However, the rate limiting was IP-specific, not user-specific. This flaw allowed attackers to bypass protection using thousands of IP addresses via cloud services and perform a distributed brute-force attack.

# Key Insight:
The vulnerability was in the design assumption—not anticipating attackers using large IP pools. Fixing such flaws often requires rebuilding major parts of the app, making them harder to address than code-level bugs.

# Prevention:
To avoid insecure design issues:

Conduct thorough threat modeling during early development.

Follow a secure development lifecycle from the start.
