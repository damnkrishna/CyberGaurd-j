# OWASP: Broken Access Control

## What is Broken Access Control?

It refers to when users and websites leave some access controls open for different users - like admin control is sometimes open in web apps.

## The 2019 YouTube Vulnerability

Here's an example: a vulnerability was found in 2019 in YouTube by some user while he was trying to gain access to his own YouTube account by his actual account for practice.

### YouTube Privacy Settings

When uploading a new video on YouTube, they give us three options: public, private, and unlisted.

- **Public**: accessible by anyone
- **Private**: only watchable by creator  
- **Unlisted**: only watchable by those who have the link for the video

## The Bug Bounty Discovery

So I just read about this crazy hack or vulnerability observed by a bug bounty guy. He recently discovered that one can watch someone's private video on YouTube if you just know that person's ID and boom - you have their personal stuff! 

The thinking behind his mindset of searching was quite unique. He kept on going deep and searching for flaws.

### Initial Attempts

First, he tried manual search by just changing access from public to private. Sometimes this case also works and lets you have access, but in his case this was not the scene. He kept on trying new things.

### The Ad Vector Approach

So then he thought, "Why not check if those ads which come when we watch a YouTube video can be of any use to him?" Great mindset! I don't know how he even got to think about that, but definitely a killer move.

So then he built his own ad and added it to his actual channel, hoping for finding any vulnerability. But still nothing. 

Man, it was quite crazy what he did next - I would have never gone to the next step if I were in his place.

### Deep Dive into Google Ads

He thought, "Why not take it as an opportunity to try and learn all about Google ads and what they do?" So while scrolling through different modes, he came to see something called "moments" which allows the creator to add moments in his video and then using that, mark video like "at 1:20 min: how to hack me." This way it gets easier for a user to watch directly key points and not waste their time watching the full video.

I still thought it that way till now, but no! He used that moment to create complete video from private video.

Bro, WTF! You got brain or Einstein brain?! Man, my brain was like "puff..."

### The Breakthrough

He came to this step because he observed that while adding moments to the video, it is sending requests to server and somehow responded to the request. He quickly used the ID provided by the response on his own private video and got a photo in base64 format, which he quickly decoded and got an image.

Later he thought, "Why not write a script that takes every picture of the private video each millisecond and then using some editor, mix the decoded photos to form a video?"

### Limitations

Though it too had flaws like:
- It doesn't have audio because it was in photo format
- Low quality of video but still readable

## My Thoughts

Hence, for me this was kind of a great discovery, and yeah, the mindset he had was unique and the way too.
