Web Application Security 

-Is SSL(secure socket layer) safe ?
	coming from an developer background to be truthful I never 	myself aimed on making my website secure or safe I just kept my 	goal to make it run and develop an user friendly frontend. I 	worked on making it attractive with usability and without even 	thinking using ssl as my security of website. Still, my world 	just changed as I read about web application security and how 	easy it is to get into web application. Ssl just saves our 	application from basic attacks not common attacks hacker to got 	evolved as developers got they now know better ways to get 	access to any application and ssl is not as secure as it looks !

-Common Web application vulnerabilities 
	-broken authentication
	-broken access controls
	-sql injection
	-cross-site scripting
	-information leakage

-Things we can do by using vulnerability of a web application or server
	just cracking vulnerability is not what some people hack into web application it also help individual in several ways like if u have access to web application of some online shopping website u can change the price of good to lower value and buy yourself for short interval of time u can gain access to online courses and plans and even hijack someone session  and retrieve sensitive information about users by acceseing their server and use it on them for benefit


-Reason behind lack of security 
	-people blindly trust that no one is going to hack into their application but sooner or later people will attack it for sensitive information 
	-mostly all website are now build by user sitting at home so they are low budget less time invested website hence they can spend much time thinking about security and all they just build the product as soon as they can without thinking of potential attacks on that website

	- One more main reason is the language people are using to build their website like JAVA it is a very old website and built for running small easy functionality and not for hosting shopping platform or providing money transferring or crypto transferring etc we just are extendending its use by forcing it to run for these things too which causes security problem hence making it easier for hackers to get in as flaws in old language can be used.
