 ## **Module 1: Introduction to IDPS**

Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) play a crucial role in modern cybersecurity. They help organizations detect malicious activities, identify security breaches, and add layers of protection.

**Intrusion** → *Action aimed to compromise security goals.*
  
 *Integrity, Confidentiality or Availability*

IDPS → *Not only works for the detection of intrusion but also works for creating/generation techniques to prevent intrusion or build a protection layer.*

To achieve this, IDPS generally uses two major approaches:

* **Signature based detection (as regex)**
* **Anomaly based detection (as training model)**

---

 ### **Signature Based**

Signature-based systems rely on known patterns of malicious activity.

* *Accurate / Low false positive*
* *Can’t detect Zero Day Attacks*
* *Easier / Basic Pattern matching
* *Have to programmed again for every new pattern*

These systems are highly reliable for known threats but fail against new, unknown attack vectors.

---

 ### **State Table**

*Used to track characteristics and status of active network connections or sessions.*
This helps the system understand ongoing behavior and detect suspicious deviations.

---

### **Components of IDPS**

* *Network Sensors or host-based agents*
* *Detection & Prevention capabilities*
* *Command Console*
* *Database → that stores attack signatures or behaviours*

Each component works together to monitor network traffic, analyze activities, and respond to threats in real time.

---
 ### **Options for IDPS**

Organizations can deploy different types of IDPS depending on their needs:

* **Network-based IDPS** → *for whole network*
* **Host-based IDPS** → *for a single host device*
* **Hybrid IDPS** → *Combination of both*

---

## **Module 2: Firewall Basics**

Firewalls remain one of the most essential security tools for protecting networks from unauthorized access.

**Firewall** → *Hardware/software configured to block unauthorized network access.*
  ↳ *Can’t protect against malicious insider*

Firewalls form the first line of defense but cannot prevent trusted insiders from misusing access.

---

 ### **DiD (Defense in Depth)**

*Layered defense strategy formation*, ensuring multiple protective layers rather than relying on one.

Layers include:

* *IDPS*
* *Firewall*
* *Antivirus*
* *Access control*
* *Auditing*

This multi-layered design ensures that even if one component fails, others continue providing protection.

---

### **Two Types of Firewalls**

* *Software-Based*
* *Hardware-Based*

---

 ### **Types of firewall include**

* *Packet filtering gateways or screening routers*
* *Stateful inspection firewall*
* *Application level gateways or proxy*
* *Guard*
* *Personal firewall*

These types differ in how deeply they inspect traffic and how much control they provide to administrators.

 ## **Module 3: Legal, Privacy and Ethical Issues in Computer Security**

This module focuses on the laws, rights, and ethical considerations surrounding cybersecurity.

 ### **Basic Legal Issues**

* *Protecting Programs and data*
* *Information and the Law*
* *Ownership Rights of Employees and Employers*

---

 ### **Copyright**

*Gives the creator exclusive right to make copies of the expression and sell them to public.*
↳ *protect intellectual property*

Copyright protects creative work from unauthorized copying or distribution.

---

 ### **Patent**

*Designed to protect inventions or ways to make them, not works of the mind.*

Patents reward innovation and prevent others from exploiting the invention without permission.

---

 ### **Trade Secret**

*Information that provides competitive edge over others.*
↳ *Reverse engineering used to uncover Trade Secret is legal*

Trade secrets protect confidential business information, but reverse engineering legally challenges their protection.

---

 ### **Criminal vs Civil Law**

A comparison of how different forms of law handle offenses in cybersecurity.

---

 ### **Law vs Ethics**

* *Law alone can’t restrict human behaviour*
    ↳ Morals are sufficient
    ↳ Self-controls for most people

Ethics go beyond law; they guide responsible behavior even when no rule exists.

---
 ### **Data Protection in India**

* *IT Act*

The Information Technology Act provides the framework for cybersecurity, digital privacy, and data protection within India
