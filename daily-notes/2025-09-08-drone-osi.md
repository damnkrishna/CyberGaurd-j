# Drone Network and Security System

## Overview

A multi-layered intrusion detection system (IDS) for drone networks that monitors and detects security threats across different network layers using the OSI model approach.

## Why OSI Model for Drone Security? ðŸ›¸

Your IDS project uses "multi-layer intrusion detection" which means:

- **Layer 2** â†’ detect Wi-Fi attacks (deauth, Evil Twin)
- **Layer 3/4** â†’ detect floods, spoofed IPs  
- **Layer 7** â†’ detect malicious MAVLink commands

Without OSI knowledge, you won't know where to look for which attack.

## Drone Control Methods

Drones can be controlled by two main ways:

### 1. Wi-Fi Connection
- **Pros**: Cheap and good video quality
- **Cons**: Prone to Wi-Fi attacks

### 2. Radio Signal Control
- **Pros**: More secure than Wi-Fi
- **Cons**: Requires specific radio connection chip, can be affected by blocking that specific signal radio

These are the two most common ways a drone can be controlled and attacked.

## Multi-layered Attack Detection

### Layer 2 Attacks - Data Link Layer
- **Wi-Fi Deauthentication Attacks**: Forcing disconnection between drone and controller
- **Evil Twin Attacks**: Fake access points to intercept communications

### Layer 3/4 Attacks - Network/Transport Layer
- **Flood Attacks**: Overwhelming the drone with network traffic
- **IP Spoofing**: Attackers using fake IP addresses to impersonate legitimate controllers

### Layer 7 Attacks - Application Layer
- **Malicious MAVLink Commands**: Injecting harmful flight commands through the MAVLink protocol

## Physical Layer Vulnerabilities (Most Prone)

The physical layer is the most vulnerable point of attack for drone systems:

### GPS Spoofing/Jamming
- **GPS Spoofing**: Attacker transmits fake GPS signals stronger than real ones
  - Drone thinks it's elsewhere
  - Result: Redirected, stolen, or crashed
  
- **GPS Jamming**: Blocking legitimate GPS signals

### Radio Frequency Interference
- Specific radio signals used to control drones can be blocked
- Results in drone crashes or hijacking
- **Real-world example**: In Interstellar, the main hero blocked drone signals causing it to crash in an open field which he then fixed
- Same principle applies to:
  - Remote-controlled bombs
  - Any remote-controlled device
  - Car control systems (like in Mr. Robot series where they could have stopped the car chase by remote controlling and shutting it down)

### Signal Jamming for Protection
Politicians and high-security areas use signal jammers to stop remote control attacks and prevent unauthorized drone operations.

## Specific Attack Vectors

### Drone Command Flooding
- Send huge amount of bogus commands to the drone
- Similar to DoS (Denial of Service) attacks
- **Impact**: Drone might freeze, crash, or fail to respond to legitimate commands

### GPS Spoofing
- Attacker transmits fake GPS signals stronger than real signals
- Drone thinks it's elsewhere
- **Impact**: Drone gets redirected, stolen, or crashes

### Video Hijacking Attempts
- Attacker intercepts or injects malicious content into drone's video feed
- Operators see wrong footage
- **Impact**: Operators can be tricked or blinded to actual situation

## How Cool Is This?

The ability to control or disable remote devices through signal manipulation is fascinating and has real-world applications in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity. From movie scenarios to actual security implementations, understanding these attack vectors is crucial for building robust drone defense systems.

## Security Implementation

This project implements detection mechanisms for all these attack vectors across multiple OSI layers, providing comprehensive protection for drone networks against both cyber and physical attacks.
