# Nmap Basics â€“ June 2, 2025

## What I learned today:
- How to use `nmap` to scan for open ports on a local network.
- The command `nmap -sT 192.168.1.0/24 -p 3306` scans port 3306 on all devices.

## Key commands:
- `-sT`: TCP Connect scan
- `-p`: Specify ports

## Notes:
- Make sure you are on the same network.
- Some devices may not respond if firewalled.
