# My Learning Journey - January 16, 2026

## Today's Plan

well today i took holiday from my college cause i only have one class to attend today so i decided why not finish the stuff i am ignoring for weeks and do some light project and gain knowledge this weekend and from Monday start fresh with new certification 

so i enrolled and bought certification exam of isc2 cc exam it will be on 26th feburary 2026 

so for now my task is to finish the google cyber certification today as only the last module is left with almost minimal knowledge based upon cyber and most on ai and how to get job and stuff 

so for my todays task i will first finish google cyber professional certification then write a post about it and post on linkedin to keep my linkedin account active 

then from the evening i will start working on ai/ml as i actually fear ai/ml and i have been saying everyone that i dont know ai/ml and i cant do it but it is not rocket science and i too can get some brief knowledge about it as it is the future of tech i should not revolt against it and just accept it as fate and try to live with it and learn it a little 

learning a little wont harm so thats my plan for today 

first i will finish google course so here i go

## Update: Google Course Completed

well i have successfully finished google course and have even posted the writeup on linkedin post 

now i will start the ai/ml theory and stuff work

## Machine Learning Basics

### What is Machine Learning?

well lets start with what exactly is machine learning 

well there is ml everywhere whenever u search something it is ml that is making it quick and efficient or u ask some tips or ask some question there is ai/ml somewhere and everything rn contains ai/ml somewhere

machine learning is using data to find pattern and results based upon data rather than following rules that are hard-coded 

### Types of Machine Learning Models

well there is two main type of machine learning model 
- Supervised model
- Unsupervised model 

well the supervised model is using data that is already taged like u have both input and output and labels so u have structure u just have to train the model 

whereas in unsupervised model we just have data or input we dont have any label or any info about data the model itself find structure and usually it is done by experienced engineer as it requires better data knowledge and techniques 

---

## Regression vs Classification

our next topic of discussion is regression vs classification 

well regression refers to predicts a number which we have assigned to the data for training model  

whereas classification refer to prediction on the basis of category which u have decided 

---

## Features and Labels

well features is the stuff we get as input and categorises them like variables date id etc

and labels are the tags we give to the output like final score or malicious/normal type stuff

basically having bad features results in a bad model so from starting we have be focused and clearly now what the features are and what the labels will be in the output 

---

## Model Training Process

next step in ml comes out to train = learn patterns based upon dataset 
validate it tune the model 
and finally test the model for final evaluation 

### Dataset Split (80/20 Rule)

also in case of training and testing a dataset we have to split dataset into 80/20 as 80% data is provided to train the model and rest 20% data is used to test the model after training 

also this split decides how our model will work in future cause lesser the dataset lesser the accuracy cause it will have less dataset to detect pattern upon and train model so u cant usually change the split as to train model we need enough data and to train too we need fresh data that is not previously used for training as it is used for performing test or prediction 

and all the above i mentioned about split also have terms like overfitting and underfitting 

---

## Bias-Variance Tradeoff

next is bias-variance tradeoff 
- high-bias: too simple -> underfit
- high variance: too complex -> overfit

explain why accuracy changes 

---

## Feature Scaling

then comes feature scaling it is used to convert data to similar scale or normalize or standardize the data so it can be used for training model that depends upon distance 

common method to do scaling is by 
- standard scaler (-3,+3)
- normalization (0,1) 

---

## Evaluation Metrics

next topic is evaluation metrics 
- regression metrics 
- classification metrics

as accuracy alone can sometime be misleading hence we create metrices to understand result

### Confusion Matrix

one also way is it use confusion matrix by putting data into 4 boxes 
- true positive 
- false positive
- true negative 
- false negative 

---

## Model Selection

next comes trying different multiple models instead of trusting one as no single model is best for all problem every model have different power and problems 

hence clearly understanding your data and what model it will support with trying multiple model in end result in building a model that is best for the dataset u are using and desire from it
