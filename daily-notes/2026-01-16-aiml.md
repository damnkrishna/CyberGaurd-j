# My Learning Journey - January 16, 2026

## Today's Decision
Today, I took a holiday from college since I only had one class to attend. I decided to use this time productively by finishing the tasks I've been ignoring for weeks, working on some light projects, and gaining new knowledge over the weekend. Starting Monday, I plan to begin fresh with a new certification.

## New Certification Goal
I enrolled in and purchased the **ISC2 CC (Certified in Cybersecurity)** certification exam, scheduled for **February 26, 2026**.

## Today's Tasks

### Morning Goal: Complete Google Cybersecurity Certification
For now, my primary task is to finish the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate today. Only the last module remains, which focuses on:
- Minimal cybersecurity knowledge
- AI applications in cybersecurity
- Job search strategies and career guidance

### Plan of Action
1. **Complete the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification**
2. **Write a post about it**
3. **Share on LinkedIn** to keep my account active

### Evening Goal: Start AI/ML Learning
From the evening onwards, I will start working on AI/ML fundamentals.

## Overcoming My Fear of AI/ML
I've been telling everyone that I don't know AI/ML and that I can't do it. But the truth is, it's not rocket science. I too can gain some foundational knowledge about it. Since AI is the future of technology, I shouldn't revolt against it. Instead, I should accept it and try to learn alongside it.

Learning a little won't harm—it can only help me grow.
