# WiFi Basics

## The Hacking Scene
Have you ever watched hacking series or stuff? So the most common scene is when a hacker uses cafe WiFi or somebody else's WiFi that is available online. Yeah, sometimes they use free WiFi while sometimes they hack into someone's WiFi then use it for their dirty work. So when they hack someone and when people try to track him down, he can send that person to the WiFi provider or net provider and not link them to you. Yeah, they too got backdoor and stuff to track you back down.

## The Reality in India
But in India, have you ever heard that any person tried to hack or get caught? Because the people learning such stuff is relatively very very low and normally people are running after web dev and easy money stuff. But what can I do? This black hat stuff got my interest nowadays and I think it is the only IT thing I genuinely liked and wanted to study as my future career.

## Learning WiFi Hacking
So here I will be learning how to hack WiFi initially. Some basics you should know about WiFi before doing something like that:

### 1. Wi-Fi Basics (What You MUST Know First)
Before hacking anything, you need to understand what you're dealing with.

#### ðŸ“¡ Wi-Fi Terms You Should Know:
- **SSID** â€“ Name of the Wi-Fi network
- **BSSID** â€“ MAC address of the router
- **WPA/WPA2/WPA3** â€“ Wi-Fi encryption protocols
- **Handshake** â€“ When a device connects to Wi-Fi, it exchanges info with the router (you can capture this to try to crack the password)
- **2.4GHz vs 5GHz** â€“ Different frequency bands. Most hacking tools work better with 2.4GHz

#### ðŸ“¶ Common Tools:
- **airmon-ng** â€“ Enable monitor mode
- **airodump-ng** â€“ Scan for networks and capture handshakes
- **aireplay-ng** â€“ Deauthenticate clients to force handshake
- **aircrack-ng** â€“ Crack the password from captured handshake
- **hcxdumptool + hashcat** â€“ Advanced combo to capture and crack

## Hardware Requirements
To run these tools I would require an outside WiFi adapter that supports my Linux setup and also scan the network for possible connections rather than just connecting to my own. And while doing these stuff I need a decent laptop too.
