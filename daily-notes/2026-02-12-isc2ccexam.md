## **Domain 1: Security Principles**

* **CIA Triad** – Protect data using **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**.
* **Risk Management** – Identify, assess, and reduce risks to acceptable levels.
* **Defense in Depth** – Use multiple security layers so one failure doesn’t break everything.
* **Least Privilege** – Give users only the access they absolutely need.
* **Threat Modeling** – Think like an attacker to find weaknesses before they do.

## **Domain 2: Incident Response & Business Plans**

* **Incident Response** – Structured process to detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from attacks.
* **IR Phases** – Preparation → Detection → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons learned.
* **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** – Keep critical operations running during disasters.
* **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** – Restore IT systems after major failures.
* **RTO/RPO** – Maximum acceptable downtime (RTO) and data loss (RPO).

## **Domain 3: Access Control Concepts**
A control is a  safegaurd or countermeasure designed to preserve cia triad

layered defense technique used
- physical control
- logical control
- administrative control

these three together redcues the risk of assest security to a degree 

* **Authentication** – Proving who you are.
* **Authorization** – What you’re allowed to do after authentication.
* **Accounting (AAA)** – Tracking user actions for auditing.
* **DAC/MAC/RBAC** – Access based on owner, policy, or role.
* **MFA** – Multiple factors drastically reduce account compromise.

two-person integrity:

this refers to giving a single job to two person with no one knowing the full process as one will know half process and other one will know other half process this help in reducing internal harm by employee or malicious intent people

eg: in bank for vault opening one person knows the first 4 terms of password 
and the other person know the other 4 terms of password and at last result in vault opening 
this safe the company or people from having single point of filure type situation

## **Domain 4: Network Security**

two or more computers linked together to share data information or resources is a network 
- LAN
- WAN

network devices:
- hubs
- switch
- router
- firewall
- server
- endpoint

microsegmentation: zero trust at network level enforced everywhere
- security technique where you break a network into very small isolated segments and tightly control how each segment can talk to others
- to enforce the concept of least privilege

prevents threats
- keep system and application up to date
- remove or disable unneeded services and protcols
- use idps
- use firewall
- use up-to-date anti-malware software or antivirus

- demilitarized zone
- virtual private network
- web-application firewall
- virtual local area network
- network access control
- managed servie providers
- service level aggreement

## **Domain 5: Security Operations**

* **Monitoring** – Continuous visibility into systems and logs.
* **SIEM** – Centralized log analysis and alerting.
* **Vulnerability Management** – Find, prioritize, and patch weaknesses.
* **Hardening** – Reduce attack surface by removing unnecessary services.
* **SOC** – Team responsible for real-time security defense.

## **OWASP Top 10 (1-liners + hands-on hint)**

1. **Broken Access Control** – Users can do things they shouldn’t → test with role bypass.
2. **Cryptographic Failures** – Weak or missing encryption → inspect TLS, hashes.
3. **Injection** – Attacker controls queries/commands → practice SQLi, command injection.
4. **Insecure Design** – App logic itself is unsafe → threat model early.
5. **Security Misconfiguration** – Default creds, open ports → scan and exploit.
6. **Vulnerable Components** – Outdated libraries → exploit known CVEs.
7. **Auth Failures** – Weak login/session handling → brute force & session tests.
8. **Software Integrity Failures** – Untrusted updates/code → tamper with builds.
9. **Logging & Monitoring Failures** – Attacks go unnoticed → test alert gaps.
10. **SSRF** – Server makes attacker-controlled requests → access internal services.

👉 **Hands-on tip:** Use labs (DVWA, Juice Shop) until exploitation feels routine.
