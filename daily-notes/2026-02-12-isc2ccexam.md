## **Domain 1: Security Principles**

* **CIA Triad** – Protect data using **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**.
* **Risk Management** – Identify, assess, and reduce risks to acceptable levels.
* **Defense in Depth** – Use multiple security layers so one failure doesn't break everything.
* **Least Privilege** – Give users only the access they absolutely need.
* **Threat Modeling** – Think like an attacker to find weaknesses before they do.

## **Domain 2: Incident Response & Business Plans**

* **Incident Response** – Structured process to detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from attacks.
* **IR Phases** – Preparation → Detection → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons learned.
* **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** – Keep critical operations running during disasters.
* **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** – Restore IT systems after major failures.
* **RTO/RPO** – Maximum acceptable downtime (RTO) and data loss (RPO).

## **Domain 3: Access Control Concepts**
A control is a safegaurd or countermeasure designed to preserve cia triad

layered defense technique used
- physical control
- logical control
- administrative control

these three together redcues the risk of assest security to a degree 

* **Authentication** – Proving who you are.
* **Authorization** – What you're allowed to do after authentication.
* **Accounting (AAA)** – Tracking user actions for auditing.
* **DAC/MAC/RBAC** – Access based on owner, policy, or role.
* **MFA** – Multiple factors drastically reduce account compromise.

two-person integrity:

this refers to giving a single job to two person with no one knowing the full process as one will know half process and other one will know other half process this help in reducing internal harm by employee or malicious intent people

eg: in bank for vault opening one person knows the first 4 terms of password 
and the other person know the other 4 terms of password and at last result in vault opening 
this safe the company or people from having single point of filure type situation

## **Domain 4: Network Security**

two or more computers linked together to share data information or resources is a network 
- LAN
- WAN

network devices:
- hubs
- switch
- router
- firewall
- server
- endpoint

microsegmentation: zero trust at network level enforced everywhere
- security technique where you break a network into very small isolated segments and tightly control how each segment can talk to others
- to enforce the concept of least privilege

prevents threats
- keep system and application up to date
- remove or disable unneeded services and protcols
- use idps
- use firewall
- use up-to-date anti-malware software or antivirus

- demilitarized zone
- virtual private network
- web-application firewall
- virtual local area network
- network access control
- managed servie providers
- service level aggreement

## **Domain 5: Security Operations**

* **Monitoring** – Continuous visibility into systems and logs to detect anomalies early.
* **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** – Centralized platform that collects, correlates, and alerts on log data from across the environment. Examples: Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, IBM QRadar.
* **Vulnerability Management** – Ongoing cycle of scanning, finding, prioritizing, and patching weaknesses before attackers exploit them.
* **Hardening** – Reduce attack surface by disabling unnecessary services, closing unused ports, removing default credentials, and applying secure configurations (CIS Benchmarks are a good reference).
* **SOC (Security Operations Center)** – Dedicated team responsible for real-time monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.
* **Patch Management** – Process of regularly applying updates to OS, software, and firmware to fix known vulnerabilities. Unpatched systems are one of the most common attack vectors.
* **Threat Intelligence** – Collecting and analyzing data about current threats, attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to stay ahead of adversaries. Feeds into SIEM and detection rules.
* **Log Management** – Collecting, storing, and reviewing logs from systems, applications, and network devices. Logs are critical for forensic investigations and compliance.
* **Change Management** – Controlled process for making changes to IT systems so that new changes don't introduce new vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
* **Asset Management** – Knowing what devices, software, and data exist in your environment. You can't protect what you don't know about.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** – Tools deployed on endpoints (laptops, servers) to detect, investigate, and respond to threats in real time. Examples: CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne.
* **Threat Hunting** – Proactive approach where analysts manually search through data to find hidden threats that automated tools may have missed. Goes beyond alert-driven detection.
* **Forensics & Evidence Handling** – Collecting and preserving digital evidence after an incident in a forensically sound manner (chain of custody) so it can be used for investigation or legal proceedings.
* **Configuration Management** – Ensuring systems are consistently configured according to approved baselines and that unauthorized changes are detected quickly.

## **Interview Tools (1-liners)**

* **Ghidra** – Reverse-engineering tool to analyze malware and binaries.
* **Frida** – Dynamic instrumentation to hook and modify running apps in real time.
