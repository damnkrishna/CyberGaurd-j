# OWASP Security Vulnerabilities Notes

## OWASP 8: Software and Data Integrity Failures

A little bit about this again - while trying to enter a website, always use token correctly. One dot missing while pasting the data can cause a lot of your time, so try to not miss any token part.

Remember while trying to enter admin using token, you can skip the use of signature part of the token and just focus on decoding header and payload and editing them for your use.

**Token Format:** `header.payload.signature`

**Input:** `header.payload.`

Writing this because I wasted a lot of my time fixing the error of last dot in my cookie, but later I realized and fixed it.

## OWASP 9: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

When web applications are set up, every action performed by the user should be logged. Logging is important because, in the event of an incident, the attackers' activities can be traced. Once their actions are traced, their risk and impact can be determined. Without logging, there would be no way to tell what actions were performed by an attacker if they gain access to particular web applications.

### Information Stored in Logs Should Include:
- HTTP status codes
- Time stamps
- Usernames
- API endpoints/page locations
- IP addresses

So these data store a lot of information about the person logging in. If some website is breached, they have their IP and data stored by the application for their own info, which have importance of securing it too. If someone gained access to this log data, he can get username and access role of the person, and he can also get the IP address of the specific person and maybe do something harmful with that.

As you might have watched the famous series Mr. Robot - in that, Elliot used the IP address of CEO of E-Corp to frame his device for the location of the IP from where the hack happened. The only important data that usually is traced back by safety people of that application is the device IP, and it is the reason most of the hackers get caught.

But if used properly, it can make you the securest guy online.

So yeah, if someone gets these logs, they totally can enter into your web application by performing cracking tool on the application as they got your username and your position in web application as admin or as user. But if you think at a bigger level, someone can frame you for their hacks easily too, and you can do nothing because the IP was yours that was found in the hack. So whatever you say, you have hacked someone and it is a big offense and can result in jail.

So remember to keep these logs safe.

## OWASP 10: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

SSRF occurs when a server-side application fetches a URL based on user input, and an attacker manipulates that input to make the server send requests to unintended locations â€” like internal systems, cloud metadata services, or localhost.

**In short:** You make the server send requests on your behalf, often to places it should never talk to.

Need to study more about this - it is a high level attack, need a lot of brain and experience to do stuff like this. Will write about this more in future.
