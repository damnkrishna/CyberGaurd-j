# Sock Puppet for OSINT – Raw Thoughts & First Experience

So this part was not something I thought would be coming in this blog, but it showed up on my screen, so why not complete it here only?

You want to have an account that doesn't connect back to you — that is completely anonymous — that you can use to do stuff you can’t do with your main account or ID for the risk of getting traced back. So here come the sock puppets. It’s like building a fake version of you, with you controlling it, but it doesn’t connect back to you. It’s just a puppet that you control.

Mainly for OSINT, you don't want to scan people with your main account or identity. If you want to keep an eye on someone, you might want to do it anonymously and safely. So yeah, the importance of a puppet for a hacker is real.

## Safety First Before You Build

I think I’ll put this in at the end of this blog, because first someone should learn the setup and only later the safety to keep in mind.

Before building a fake identity, remember that you are giving your IP, your real name, and everything just to build a fake one. So remember to use a VPN, and if possible, browse with a secure laptop while doing OSINT on anyone.

So I used a VPN or Brave browser and went to all these websites.

## Step 1 – Fake Identity Creation

First, I created a fake identity.

I couldn’t build an Indian ID right now. I don’t think it is safe. So just for practice, I built a German ID of a girl who is 61 years old.

## Step 2 – AI-Generated Image

Next, I built an AI-generated image that doesn’t belong to anyone.

Finding a face of a 61-year-old German woman was tough — might take time. But eventually, I found one that looked pretty convincing.

## Step 3 – Virtual Credit Card

The video I was watching said we can even create a complete fake virtual credit card, and buy something with it — and maybe not pay for it — as that card would expire in one month. Interesting, right?

But don’t do it. You’ll be tracked. As long as you're just learning, you're good to go. But the moment you decide to harm someone or use it for real — it’s not legal anymore.

Think wisely before doing anything like this.

I know it sounds cool, but don’t try it ever.

## Step 4 – Social Media Handles

I built an Instagram handle using these tools.

I’ve tried to create fake Instagram handles many times before, but was never able to build one properly. Now finally, I did it. I was honestly happy after doing this.

Then I went ahead and created a Facebook account and a Gmail account using this identity.

Creating the Facebook account was easy at first, but I got stuck when it asked me to upload a video selfie of myself. I didn’t know how to bypass it, so I’m leaving it for now.

## Observation: Facebook Is Getting Smarter

After reading some documentation, I found out Facebook recently made their software more secure against fraud. So now, without a video selfie, you can’t build a new account.

But platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn still have very low security, so I built accounts on those for now.

## Final Setup: My Puppet Lives

I completed it. I built an Instagram account with a proper bio and photo, and similarly, one for Twitter and one for LinkedIn.

## Advanced Tips (Optional)

If you're thinking about building a sock puppet and taking it to the next level, you can also:

- Buy a burner phone and SIM card for making your profile more realistic
- Use that number to control and verify accounts
- Assign that number to the fake identity you created from the generator

This will allow you to perform higher-level OSINT assignments without revealing your personal info.

## That’s All for Now

I don’t want to go any further right now. I’ve built my fake handles.

Proceeding beyond this will require a higher skill set and real money, so I’ll stop for now.
