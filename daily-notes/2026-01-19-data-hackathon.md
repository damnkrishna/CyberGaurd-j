# Data Hackathon : Aadhar Data Anomaly Detection

## Initial Understanding and Approach

So now after gaining some basic knowledge regarding AI/ML and dataset, I am thinking of seeing the dataset provided by DataHackathon of Aadhar data of some years with only numerical data like new enrollment, demographic update and biometric update type stuff log and using that type of data we have identify technique to find anomality and fraud happening in some place or locality using the dataset of past years.

### Dataset Overview

Well the dataset is too large - it is around 30 lakh rows and 8 columns of data.

Well last time I didn't have any idea what exactly is the use of these dataset can be but now atleast I know a little. I know there is possibility of finding stuff using these dataset.

## Current Progress

Well I did some part in it, later will be done in evening now as they will help me out after sometime cause based upon my code and my current knowledge I did what I could have done. Well I could have done better but what can I say, I need some help. I am no expert in such stuff, well they are and they can help if they want to help so I will build the project with them. That way I will get knowledge from them and will enhance my knowledge of AI/ML and been able to observe their workflow might even help me maybe.

## Team Structure

Well so we divided the work and my teammates are Aryan and Suri.

### Team Members

**Aryan** is expert in analytics but he is more like follow rules and expect every other to do the same in case of project working.

**Suri** is like he got great real world experience and is actually great and making AI do the work for him.

## Work Division Strategy

So we all three built and trained our own individual model and try different thing on your own and later we will add all are ideas in one that is just perfect and just like that we build our model and our date of submission is tomorrow so have to complete it before tomorrow and create report.

## Review of Suri's Project

So I checked Suri project out and it was just great - model was well trained, structure was perfect and everything was just nice even the plot and cleaned dataset was great but his model was just giving of around 80k anomalious stuff but we dont want that, we want accuracy with result.

### Improvements Made to Suri's Model

So I improved his model and setup some custom engineering feature using dataset and also I narrowed down the result to top 10 and even I plotted top 5 of them in case study format which will help in analyze the result and everything.

## Next Steps

Now is the time to analyze Aryan project and see what I can update in it and will it be of any use for our project. Lets see what we can do.
