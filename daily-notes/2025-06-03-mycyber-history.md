# My Journey into Cybersecurity: From Web Development to Ethical Hacking

## My History

I am currently in my second year of B.Tech CSE. Until last week, I was working on web development and full-stack development of websites. 

However, as my semester break holidays started, I thought, "Why not try something new and interesting? Maybe it will become my new favorite thing." So I decided to start learning about the least reputed field in India - hacking and cybersecurity. While cyber professionals in India are not paid much at entry level, making it risky, the benefits are high at higher levels. Hence, I decided to give it a shot.

## Things I Have Done Already

- **Set up Kali Linux Virtual Box** on my Windows 11 laptop. I was thinking of using it in dual boot format with Windows, but as a beginner, I shouldn't be making quick decisions, so I left it for now.

- **Read "Linux Basics for Hackers" chapters 1-10** - it gave me a basic understanding of how Linux works and how to run basic commands.

- **Created accounts on online platforms** like HackTheBox Academy and TryHackMe for better understanding from multiple platforms.

## My Thoughts and Realizations

### The Mr. Robot Inspiration
I am a huge fan of Mr. Robot, and it eventually creates a spark in everyone's mind who watches it - to hack and do crazy cool things and change the world. For me, it was like an escape from people, as I liked the mindset of the main character Elliot. He is an introverted, shy guy, but inside he knows more about computers than any other hacker. Still, he never misused his skills for his own sake, for money, or for materialistic things. He kept a big goal of changing the world. 

I feel like once greed comes into a hacker's life, it's over. But Elliot never got greedy and understood when to stop and when to restart. Sometimes I wonder whether Elliot's split personality was the one helping him out all the time, and whether it's possible for normal people to do that.

### Hardware Requirements Reality Check
When I started trying things myself, I understood the importance of having a good laptop with better RAM and higher GPU. Until now, I always thought, "What difference would it make to have slightly less or more RAM? It's useless. Why do people focus on RAM or storage?"

But as I tried, I got to know that these tools and servers required for cybersecurity need quite specific laptop specifications. You can't just run some tools on a 4GB RAM laptop, and some laptops don't even provide WiFi network checking or scanning capabilities. Hence, having a good laptop with specific specifications is very important for someone in cybersecurity.

### The Reality of "Hacking"
Don't get me wrong - like all people, I got interested in this field thinking about hacking somebody or gaining passwords or exploiting someone's laptop, WiFi, or accounts. But it is not quite as easy as it looks in movies and series. It's complex and requires a lot of learning about the target device.

For example, some devices don't even support remote desktop. So if you were wondering about getting into someone's laptop using their IP, username, and password, it's not possible that way because their laptop just doesn't allow it. Also, to do this, you need to know their IP, laptop username, password, and even if you somehow got all this, you need to disable their Windows firewall, check for remote desktop settings, and change it to allow remote desktop - all this requires you to already have physical access to their laptop.

So I realized it's not so easy. It requires a lot of knowledge, proper tools, and specifications. But isn't it quite interesting to do that? Once you gain all the knowledge required above, you have access to someone's laptop and screen - how cool would it feel to be able to do such things?

I know for some, I might sound like some crazy guy who finds hacking cool, but isn't it actually cool though? For info, I am doing all this on my own laptop, not someone else's - at least not for now :)

I will be doing penetration testing and white hat hacking or ethical hacking only.

## What I Will Be Doing Next

### Linux-Only OS
I have an old Windows laptop with Windows 10 Pro which allows remote desktop. I will be converting it into a Linux-only OS by reformatting it and installing Linux.
*(Reminder for me: try screen sharing in Kali Linux on the old laptop as it allows remote desktop access for trial)*

### WiFi Adapter
My laptop, as I mentioned, doesn't support network scanning. I googled and found that some laptops just don't support network scanning, but they will if you buy a WiFi adapter. It boosts your connection and also provides a lot of help for cybersecurity professionals to scan other devices through WiFi networks.

### Setting Up a Lab
As you might be familiar with, hackers get caught or jailed for breaching networks without consent or selling private information. This happens because the hacker was either a newbie or didn't know how to keep themselves anonymous while doing their work.

It's not easy nowadays - everyone is aware of hacks and security needs. In previous times, people used cafe WiFi to become invisible, but now it's not like that anymore. These cafes also keep a backdoor open where they record logout time, IP, and devices connected to their WiFi. So if some hack happens from their cafe, they will be able to keep records of who and when, making cafes unsafe for hackers too.

Hence the importance of setting up your own Safe Lab where you can control the entire environment, your IP, and everything that might harm you later. You don't need to go to cafes or anything - just make yourself invisible by setting up labs yourself. I know it's costly, so I won't be targeting it right now. I will do it later, but yes, I will do it.
