## OWASP #7: Identification and Authentication Failures

### What it means
When a website or app doesn't properly confirm who a user is, attackers can pretend to be someone else.

### Common problems
- Weak or guessable passwords allowed
- No limit on login attempts (so brute force is easy)
- No two-factor authentication
- Session tokens that are predictable or not protected
- Users stay logged in even after password change

### What an attacker can do
They can log in as someone else, steal accounts, or get admin access if the app doesn't check identity properly.

### Real-world impact examples
- The 2019 Capital One breach involved weak authentication controls that allowed an attacker to access over 100 million customer records
- Many credential stuffing attacks succeed because users reuse passwords across multiple sites

### How to prevent it
- Require strong passwords
- Add two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Block or delay after many failed login attempts
- Always log users out after password change
- Use secure methods to store and manage sessions

### Additional prevention measures
- Implement account lockout policies (but be careful not to enable denial-of-service attacks)
- Use secure password reset mechanisms with time-limited tokens
- Monitor for suspicious login patterns (unusual locations, devices, or timing)
- Implement proper session management with secure, random session IDs
- Consider passwordless authentication methods like WebAuthn/FIDO2

## OWASP #8: Software and Data Integrity Failures

### What it means
When software or data comes from untrusted sources or isn't checked for tampering, attackers can slip in malicious code.

### Common problems
- Updating software without checking if it's genuine
- Using third-party plugins or libraries from unsafe sources
- CI/CD pipelines (automated deployment systems) that are not secure
- Dependency confusion â€“ downloading the wrong software package from public sources

### What an attacker can do
They can insert backdoors or malware into your app, and users won't even know they installed a compromised version.

### Real-world examples
- The SolarWinds attack (2020) where malicious code was inserted into software updates
- NPM package hijacking where attackers publish malicious packages with names similar to popular ones
- The Codecov bash uploader compromise that affected thousands of development environments

### How to prevent it
- Use only trusted sources for code and libraries
- Sign and verify software updates
- Secure your development and deployment systems (CI/CD)
- Regularly audit dependencies and lock versions

### Additional prevention strategies
- Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all components
- Use dependency scanning tools that check for known vulnerabilities
- Implement code signing and verification throughout your pipeline
- Use container image scanning and only pull from trusted registries
- Set up monitoring for unexpected changes in dependencies

### Pipeline security specifics
- Secure your CI/CD environment with proper access controls
- Use immutable build artifacts
- Implement proper secrets management (never hardcode credentials)
- Regularly rotate access tokens and API keys

## Key Takeaways

Both of these vulnerabilities emphasize that security isn't just about the code you write - it's about the entire ecosystem of authentication, dependencies, and deployment processes that support your application.
